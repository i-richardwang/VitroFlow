"""The canonical images this machine holds, shared by inference and training.

An image is named by the digest of its bytes and never changes, so one copy
serves every model version that reads it and every run that trains on it. A
file appears under its digest only after its bytes were verified, so a file
that exists is the image. Work pins what it is about to read; the cache keeps
within its budget by forgetting the least recently used images nothing pins.
