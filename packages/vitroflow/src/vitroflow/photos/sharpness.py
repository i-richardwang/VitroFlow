"""Compare how sharply two photographs of one dish render its seeds.

Both photographs are measured at the same physical points, so content cancels
and only focus remains. At each point, detail finer than a seed's outline is
weighed against the outline itself: defocus erodes the first faster than the
second, while exposure scales both alike. Labels sit on the lid, in another
focal plane, so only points well inside the dish take part.

The lid is higher than the seeds, so a change of camera height moves the seeds
a little differently from the dish as a whole. Seeds are therefore paired by
the motion of their own plane, which must stay close to the dish's.
