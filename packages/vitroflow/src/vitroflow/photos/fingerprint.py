"""Recognize two photographs of one dish by the layout of everything in it.

Seeds, the substrate's outline and the lid's labels together form a layout no
other dish shares. Two photographs show the same dish when one rigid motion of
the camera carries that layout from one onto the other across the whole dish;
a patch that agrees alone, such as a date label every dish of a batch carries,
does not.
