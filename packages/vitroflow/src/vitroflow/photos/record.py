"""The record of a sorted folder: each dish's photographs, and what a person confirmed.

Sorting suggests the first photograph of a dish and says whether its seeds can
be counted. A person's confirmation is kept beside that suggestion as the
dish's ``decision``, which names the photograph to use and whether it can be
counted.
